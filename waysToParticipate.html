<p>This page is under construction. It contains a list of possible ways to participate in the project, but the list is currently incomplete. Even when it is complete, it will continually be updated as the status of our short-term goals changes.</p>

<h1>Theoretical questions</h1>

<p>One of the main strands of the project will be to attempt to answer various (mostly quite open-ended) theoretical questions connected with automatic theorem proving. Some preliminary discussion of these questions can be found in Section 8 of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-FFa6nMVg18m1zPtoAQrFalwpx2YaGK4/view?usp=sharing">the long document that accompanied the first announcement of this project</a>. A high priority in the early stages of the project will be the first two questions listed there, which are really two aspects of the same question. That question is whether it is possible to formalize in a reasonable way the notion of a "fully motivated proof" -- that is, a proof for which the steps are not just correct, but are also explainable as the result of a natural search process. It is perhaps clearer to express the concept negatively: anyone with a mathematical background will have encountered "rabbits out of hats", that is, steps that appear to come out of nowhere but magically do the job required of them. But what exactly is it about such steps that causes us to view them this way? With a proper understanding of this, we could define a motivated proof to be one that contains no rabbits out of hats.</p>
